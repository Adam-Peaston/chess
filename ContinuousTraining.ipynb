    "## Plan for continuous training\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the plan. The script boots up and checks a continuous play directory which is populated with a number of training round sub-directores. Each sub-directory is labelled in sequence and contains a self_play sub-sub-directory. The script takes stock of the contents of the latest training round self_play directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the number of files (tournaments) saved in the self_play directory of the latest training round is less than some minimum M, say m < M then the self-play script is kicked off to play M - m more tournaments, completing the M requred self-play tournaments and saving to the  subdirectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the number of files saved in the self_play directory of the latest training round m >= M then the script checks if there is already a model saved in the training round directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is not a model saved in the training round directory, the script will kick off a training routine to create a new model (or load a saved model from a possibly existing previous round), compile a training dataset from the most recent k training rounds (including all known checkmate positions) and train the model to stopping. The script will then save the model in the training round sub-directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the script will create a new training round directory, labelled with the next integer in the training round sequence, containing a self_play directory. At this point we can essentially continue the loop from the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turns out multiprocessing is an excellent solution to CUDA memory management. Spinning up a separate process for training means all memory allocation is removed afterward."
